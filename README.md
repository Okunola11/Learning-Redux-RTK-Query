# Redux RTK Query

This project is a documentation of my learning and progress of redux RTK query. After proper learning and implementation of the library, I will be highlighting what I have learnt.

## My take and learning upon completion of this task.

Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) being a data fetching and state management library for React applications simplifies the process of managing and fetching data from APIs while seamlessly integrating with Redux. <Br />
Here are my key takeaways from using `RTK Query` in `React` apps:

- Simplified API Data Fetching:

RTK Query provides a simple and consistent API for data fetching. It abstracts away the complexities of managing API calls, reducing boilerplate code.

- Automatic Cache Management:

RTK Query comes with built-in caching mechanisms, eliminating the need to manually manage caching logic. It automatically stores and updates cache data, reducing unnecessary network requests.


- Normalized Data Handling:

RTK Query automatically normalizes and denormalizes data, making it easier to work with normalized data structures. Having arrays of IDs and Entities simplifies data manipulation and ensures a consistent data shape across the application.


- Integrated with Redux:

RTK Query is designed to seamlessly integrate with Redux. It leverages Redux for state management, providing a single source of truth for both local and remote data.


- Automatic State Management:

State management is handled automatically by RTK Query, reducing the need for manual state updates. This makes it easier to keep the application state in sync with the server.


- Query Lifecycle Hooks:

RTK Query provides lifecycle hooks for queries, mutations, and subscriptions. These hooks make it easy to handle loading, error, and success states, allowing for a more straightforward UI integration.


- Optimistic Updates:

RTK Query supports optimistic updates, enabling developers to update the UI immediately with an optimistic response while the actual API call is in progress. This leads to a more responsive user interface.


- Customization and Extensibility:

RTK Query is highly customizable, allowing developers to extend and modify its behavior as needed. Custom hooks and endpoints can be easily created to accommodate specific requirements.

- Developer-Friendly DevTools:

RTK Query integrates with the Redux DevTools Extension, providing developers with powerful debugging and introspection tools for inspecting API calls and their state.

### Conclusion


Learning redux toolkit as a beginner was a bit challenging yet rewarding process and using RTK Query with the toolkit instead of Axios or any other data fetching mechanism or tools feels like something I will continue implementing many times in the future. By leveraging Redux Toolkit Query, developers can streamline the process of handling data in a React application, leading to improved code maintainability, scalability, and a more efficient development workflow.
